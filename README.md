# Banking Application

I implemented what I learned reading Java: The complete Reference Eleventh Edition, and followed along with various video tutorials to make a game application. This project is meant for me to grasp terminology, and gain hands on experience using Eclipse. I wanted to learn, and observe, the JVM and JRE in action.

## Getting Started

The user should follow the instructions given in the application. The user will be prompted to provide their name, given a selection to make a withdrawl or deposit, or to exit the application via the menu.

### Prerequisities

No prerequisities are needed to use the application. The user is to make a selection from the display menu.

## Built With

This application was built using Java, no other programs are needed to play the game.

## Authors
